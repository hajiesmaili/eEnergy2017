The seventh ACM International Conference on Future Energy Systems (ACM e-Energy) aims to be the premier venue for researchers working in the broad areas of computing and communication for smart energy systems, and in energy-efficient computing and communication systems.
By bringing together researchers in a high-quality single-track conference with significant opportunities for individual and small-group interaction, it will serve as a major forum for presentations and discussions that will shape the future of this area.

#### Two types of contributions are solicited:

* __Full papers__, up to 10 pages in ACM double-column format for main body of the paper (i.e., everything excluding appendix and reference) and unlimited pages for appendix and reference, should present original theoretical and/or experimental research in any of the areas listed above that has not been published, accepted for publication, or under review by another conference or journal. The review of full papers will follow the general double-blind policy.
* __Poster/demo descriptions__, up to 2 pages in ACM double-column format showcasing work in progress are encouraged. Accepted posters/demos will be showcased in a separate session at the conference. Topics of interest are the same as research topics listed above. Preference will be given to posters/demos where the primary contribution is from one or more students. Industry participation is also encouraged.

If you belong to one of those groups you are cordially invited to submit a talk proposal (or a number of proposals). An independent program committee assesses the proposals and selects the actual conference talks.<br/>
